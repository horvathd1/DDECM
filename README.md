This repository contains the code to obtain the results of our manuscript titled Numerical Hopf Normal Form for Delay-Differential Equations.
To run the code, first make sure that both the src and ExperimentProject1 folders are inside the MATLAB path. Then you can run the ComparisonParamSet1.mlx live script to obtain the comparison of the algorithm described in the paper with the analytical center manifold reduction for parameter set I (Table 3 in the paper).
To obtain the results of the randomized simulations (Table 5 in the paper), first you need to run those simulations by opening ExperimentProject1/ExperimentProject1.prj in the MATLAB experiment manager app. Then run the experiment defined, after which you can run the RandomParamsResults.mlx live script to obtain the results.
